- 6f.. Startup
- 23f End Lag
- -11f/-11f/-9f On Shield
- Very good OOS option
	- Comes out frame 9
- Can NQ chain a lot of characters
- Not the best move to approach with as it has small reach and slow air speed
	- Will probably get whiff punished in neutral
	- Use other spacing moves like Dtilt, Fair, Bair to make them get close then use Nair
- When pressuring shield with Nair you can use Dtilt to hurt box shift out of their OOS grab.
- Very good to edge guard with
	- Very strong against tethers
	- Can soft spike when traded with some characters
- Exceptionally good at gimping some recoveries like Roy or Corrin
- Can be useful as a landing option
- Useful to reset back to neutral when in disadvantage
- Can choose whether to NQ or Nair OOS so its a very strong OOS option
- Can DIDJ to autocancel onto platforms to string combos
- Nairquake Walkoff Fair kill confirm
