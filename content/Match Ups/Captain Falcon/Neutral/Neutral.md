- [[Shield Pressure]]
- [[Gameplan]]
- Neutral is going to feel like you are keeping falcon away the whole match and that's it
	- Falcon wants to get in and feel like he can bully you
	- You need to make him respect your space
- Don't shield too much
	- He can use Usp which does 22% and is a command grab
	- A lot of his moves are very safe on your shield
	- His grab gives him a huge opening
- Falcons speed also gives him the ability to catch your landing if you become predictable
	- SH FF Landing Fair should also be unpunishable but if you do the same thing every time he can punish you for it
	- Can Spot Dodge, Jab, Nair, Shield, Ftilt after landing to mix it up
- Retreating Fairs are good at catching Falcons approaches
	- ![[Retreating Fair to catch approaches.gif]]
- Focus on understanding when they go for stomps
	- Important as Stomp > Knee is a extremely potent kill confirm
	- Stomp is very safe move with a lot of mixups
- Also focus on grabs as he gets a lot of value out of grabs
