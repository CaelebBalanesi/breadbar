# Overview
- Neutral against falcon is like swatting a fly a thousand times until it just dies
- An ideal neutral against falcon would be something like
	1. Space them to the edge of the stage with your superior range
	2. Learn what they do in the corner
	3. Get them offstage
	4. Punish their linear recovery
# Options in Neutral
- Spaced Fair/Bairs
	- Is technically unpunishable if spaced and timed but Falcon will try to punish what you do after landing
	- Can cover approaches after Fair with a Nair

	- 
- Spaced Dtilt
- Nair
	- Mostly done on [[Shield Pressure|shield]]
	- You'll mostly want to cross up as Nair is -9f and reverse Usp comes out 14f which gives enough time to spot dodge to avoid it

- Tomahawk Grab
- Ssp
- Dash Shield
- Bow
